Contact plugin with simple but flexible angular apps 

== Description ==

`With this plugin you will be able to assemble a form from a very simple one to a complex one. The best is that the created form is responsive!`

RFQWP is a next-generation way to create WordPress forms. 

* Is there on  WordPress websites a working Angular app plugin? Yes, there is! RFQWP is a plugin using two applications to solve the issue: one for admin and one for public access. 
* The RFQWP plugin is made of server PHP codes and client apps, which are the public form generator app and the admin app.
* RFQWP can manage as many contact forms as you want. You will be able to dynamically modify forms. In addition, you can fully customize the emails in your forms.

= Docs and support =

= General question types =
* Text
* Textarea
* Range
* Select
* Ratio
* Check

= Special question types =
* `Gender`: here the user selects his/her gender and the email will select an appropriate invocation.
* `Email`: emails always have a special pattern validation.  All forms must include an email, because the plugin always checks that.
* `Address`: it consists of basic text inputs, but these inputs have a special style, and can be easily recognised by their ids.
* `PickDate`: this is a calendar, where you can disable specific weekdays or add an extra price to them.
* `Accept and send form questions`: all forms have to include this field, because it includes terms and conditions.

= Privacy notices =
With the default configuration, this plugin, in itself, does not:

* track users by stealth;
* write any user personal data to the database;
* send any data to external servers;
* use cookies.
